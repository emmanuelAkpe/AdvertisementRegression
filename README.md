# AdvertisementRegression
This work seeks to create a model that will predict the sales that a company will generate with respect to advertisement expenditure across multiple channels like radio, tv, and newspaper.The steps taken have been subdivided into three parts namely, Data understanding,  Data Exploration and finally Model Building.

### Data Understanding 
In order to gain more insight into the dataset and also to determine the relationship between the features and the label, we performed an exploratory data analysis.
The following insights were drawn from the dataset:
* The dataset is made up of 200 rows and 4 columns(TV, radio, newspaper and sales)
* all the columns are numeric
* The features are TV, radio, newspaper and the target column in sales
* there are no missing values in the dataset.\
it was realized that the dataset has already been cleaned, meaning there will be no need in cleaning the dataset again.

### Data Exploration 
To fully understand the relationship between the target value(sales) and the features, we used visual exploration to achieve this goal.
We started by creating a scatter plot to show the relationship between sales and the other columns as shown below.
